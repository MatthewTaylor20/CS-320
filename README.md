How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can make sure to create and use automated testing to help to ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I can break down all the needs that the user describes to me into small specific requirements that cover all of the users needs. Then that gives me something very specific to develop and test. 

How do I approach designing software?

I think that the main consideration to designing software is to determine requirements, and then put them into place. One way of doing this is test driven development where the requirements are written as tests first and then the software is developed to make sure that all of the tests pass.
